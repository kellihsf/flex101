    <div>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. You lived before you met me?! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</div>
    <div>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. I'll get my kit! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money.</div>

    <div>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. No, just a regular mistake. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</div>
